# WE-Core
A set of core libraries for useful DSP related classes that are used by multiple White Elephant
Audio VSTs and Audio Units.

This is a headers only library, to use the DSP classes in your own projects add the include path:
`<your WE-Core directory>/WECore`.

## DSP Classes
The naming convention is that each class is prefixed with the product it was developed for.

## APIs
* __ModulationSource__ - provides a standard interface for classes which provide a modulation signal
* __EffectsProcessor__ - provides a standard interface for classes which do audio processing on mono and
stereo signals

### Modulation:
* __RichterLFO__ - substantial functionality with tempo sync, phase sync, and multiple wave types and
parameters, can accept a ModulationSource to modulate its parameters
* __AREnvelopeFollowerSquareLaw__ & __AREnvelopeFollowerFullWave__ - two different attack/release envelope
follower implementations

### Filters:
* __CarveNoiseFilter__ - a simple filter to remove noise at the extremes of human hearing
* __SongbirdFormantFilter__ - Contains multiple SongbirdBandPassFilters, designed to create vowel sounds
* __SongbirdFilterModule__ - Contains two SongbirdFormantFilters which can be blended between, with
multiple supported vowel sounds built in
* __TPTSVFilter__ - Topology preserving filter, configurable as high pass, low pass, or peak
* __MONSTRCrossover__ - A crossover filter made of several MONSTRBand units which can be provided with an
EffectsProcessor to do any form of audio processing on that band

### Distortion:
* __CarveDSPUnit__ - A waveshaping distortion module with multiple wave shapes, pre and post gain control,
and a "tweak" control which morphs the selected wave shape

### Stereo Processing:
* __StereoWidthProcessor__ - Enables narrowing or widening of the stereo image

## Documentation
Documentation is available at: https://jd-13.github.io/WE-Core/

## Required Libraries
Some classes within this library require:

A Collection of Useful C++ Classes for Digital Signal Processing: https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters

LookAndFeel classes are for building UIs using the JUCE library: https://www.juce.com/

cURL (for the experimental auto update functionality): https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

## Builds and Testing
Each DSP module has its own set of tests, found under the `WECore` directory. The file
`CMakeLists.txt` can be used to create executable binarys which run the tests. This is done as
follows:

    export WECORE_HOME=<path to your WECore>
    export WECORE_SRC=$WECORE_HOME/WECore
    cd $WECORE_HOME
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This produces the binaries:
* `WECoreTest` - Contains the standard set of unit tests
* `WECoreTestPerf` - Contains unit tests for measuring performance
